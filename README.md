# hello-world

I am almost brand new to coding. Once upon a time, long ago, I taught myself some Basic programming. I made a fun
little secret agent login game, complete with color, sounds and alarms. I thought it was awesome at the time. Outside of
that, my only coding has been very recent training on codingacademy.com.

I have been maried for 17 years. We have 2 sons, ages 4 & almost 2. We are also Foster parents and have blessed and been
blessed by nine different children thus far. We currently have 2 daughters to complement our two sons, ages 10 & 4.

I am excited to begin my training with Code Fellows in Seattle and get into a field for which I have had a long-dormant
passion, and am excited to see how it may best be utilized to make a better life for my family.

Thank you for reading, and God Bless!
